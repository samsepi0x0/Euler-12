# Euler-12


# Description:
  The program defined in the file solves the twelvth euler challenge.
  It starts by generating of traingle numbers using simple Arithmetic 
  Progression Formula
  ```bash
    term = (n * (n + 1)) / 2
  ```
  The total number of factors of a number can be determined by
  calculating total number of prime factors:
  ```bash
    Prime Factors = (x^a)*(y^b)...
    Total Factors = (a+1)*(b+1)...
  ```
  
 # Example:
   Number : 7
    
   Triangular Number: 28 { (7 * (7+1)) / 2}
   
   Prime Factors: {2, 2, 7}
   
   Total Number of Factors: 6 { 2^2, 7^1 => (2+1)*(7+1)}
   
   Total Factors: {1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28} => 6
   
 # Output:
